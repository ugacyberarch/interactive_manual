# Ransomware

We've all seen movies or heard stories about a wealthy family having a beloved
child taken away from their homes as bait for large amounts of money.  In the
digital world, that family can be you and that child can be your precious files
and data. 

All it takes is one wrong download and everything you have on your computer can
be lost forever. Or at least until you ante up a large amount of money for your
access back.  This phenomenon is known as Ransomware. 

Ransomware has been a been a prominent issue in the cybersecurity landscape for
decades now. By definition, ransomware is a type of malicious software designed
to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
