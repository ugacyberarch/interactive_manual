# How Ransomware Works

There are many ways ransomware can end up on a victim's computer.  One way is
through phishing emails that entice the recipient to download a file or click a
link that leads to the malicious software. Other ways include downloading files
on a malicious or compromised website. It is also not uncommon to have
ransomware attacks sent via social media messaging. The file downloaded is
typically an executable file, a type of file that runs a program when it is
opened. 

When the ransomware is run, it usually starts by targeting all the backup files
and folders on the infected system and removes them to prevent file recovery.
The program then performs a file encryption on all the files on the machine
that ultimately prevents usability. When that step is complete, the program
alerts the victim that their files are compromised and usually instructions
will be given describing how and who to pay for return of the files.
