# Payments and Bitcoin
Once hackers have your files under their control, they demand a ransom before
you can get them back. More often than not, the payment is required to be in
Bitcoin. This is due to the lack of recipient or sender traceability in Bitcoin
and cryptocurrency in general. 

Bitcoin is a form of cryptocurrency, digital currency designed using strong
encryption systems. It is not backed by a bank and all transactions are
verified by public databases of all cryptocurrency transactions known as
blockchains. 

However, nowadays every major bitcoin exchange is regulated by the United
State's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. So major Bitcoin related crimes
are under watch on that public blockchain making it harder for hackers to
convert the money into cash without being identified.
