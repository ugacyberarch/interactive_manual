# Introduction
The internet has changed billions of lives in the last few decades. But many do
not stop to think how it works. With web browsers serving up content in
seconds,many people don't think about what information could be compromised
each time you use the internet. 

To understand the issues, it's important to understand how the internet works.
The internet is the world's most popular computer network. A network is a
collection of machines that are connected either wired or wirelessly and are
designed to share information between each machine. When you get on your web
browser of choice and head to a website, your machine makes a request for that
website from someone else's machine. 

Without proper safety protocols, all of that information shared can be
compromised. This section covers the security risks of public wi-fi and using
Virtual Private Networks to protect yourself, and your data, regardless of what
network connection you are on.
