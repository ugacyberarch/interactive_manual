# Why to update?

Next question comes in mind, is it necessary to update software though I am
happy with the current one?

As we talked about bugs, bugs in the software are the cherry over the cake for
hackers. Hackers use these bugs to misuse the software. Software updates
contain the patches to fix the unintended bugs in software. If you don't fix
the bug in time, you may become a victim of a malware attack which will poison
your entire system. 

::: warning What is Malware? 
:bulb:
Software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized
access to a computer system.

Software updates can also help to make your life simple. For instance, in the
initial release of google chrome, to search on google, people need to hit first
google.com and then type the search query. But in the upcoming updates, the new
feature was added, so that the people can type search query in the address bar
itself and get the results. This new feature saved the time for first visiting
google.com and then typing the query. So this google chrome update made your
life easy. 

# Take Away
So updating the software will
1) Fix the bugs and protect you from malware attacks.
2) Add new features, to make your life easy.
