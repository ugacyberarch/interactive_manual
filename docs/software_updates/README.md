This is the update screen that is often seen on MacBook.

You often get software updates for your applications and even for your
Operating Systems like Android, Windows or Apple.

Sometimes it takes a lot of time and its annoying for many users. But one need
to remember that Software Updates are important and need to understand the
reasons for the updates.

Software Updates are essential in the same way the car servicing is. They are
meant to protect you and not to make your software slower or make you wait.
