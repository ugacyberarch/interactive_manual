# Summary

Software Development is a long process, and it may have some undetected bugs.

Software Updates are of two types:

1) Software Updates for fixing bugs
2) Software Updates for adding new features

Bugs can be used by hackers to get data from your device and exploit you
further. So software updates (Security Updates) which are intended for fixing
bugs are most important and helps in enhancing the software security.

Software updates for adding new features are intended to add features which may
make things simple and make software more user-friendly.

So next time before ignoring the software update check for the type of the
software update, if it's a security update, then never neglect it.
