# Why Backups Matter

Your data is of paramount importance. No matter whether you store sensitive
customer data for your eCommerce business, or you simply have oodles of cat
videos, no one wants to wake up one morning and discover that their data is
gone. Due to the nature of ever-evolving online attacks, itâ€™s impossible to
guarantee that your data will never be hacked or corrupted. The only way to
fully protect yourself is to regularly backup your data so you can fully
recover in the event of a disaster.
