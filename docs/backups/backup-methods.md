# Cloud vs Physical 

**Physical Backup**
Back Up to an External Drive: If you have an external USB hard drive, you can
just back up to that drive using your computer’s built-in backup features. On
Windows 10 and 8, use File History. On Windows 7, use Windows Backup. On Macs,
use Time Machine.

Pros: Physical storage is getting cheaper and cheaper. You always have access
to it as long as you have the hard drive. No middleman.  Cons: If you lose the
drive in a theft or accident your files are gone

**Cloud Storage**
The term cloud computing is everywhere in the tech world. But the concept is
rather simple. In the simplest term, cloud computing is storing and accessing
data and programs over the internet instead of off of your computer's hard
drive. The files and programs are ultimately on the cloud provider's computers.
The benefits of using a cloud provider is access to more storage, more
computing power, and online collaboration. 

Many companies such as Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive provide
cloud storage services. There's options to automatically sync to your online
account and to your other PCs. If you lose your hard drive, you’ll still have
the copies of the files stored online and on your other computers.

Pros: This method is easy, fast, and in many cases, free, and since it’s
online, it protects you against all types of data loss. 

Cons: Most cloud services only offer a few gigabytes of space for free, so this
only works if you have a small number of files you want to back up, or if
you’re willing to pay for extra storage. Depending on the files you want to
back up, this method can either be simpler or more complicated than a
straight-up backup program.
