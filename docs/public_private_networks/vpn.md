# Virtual Private Networks 

You may have heard about Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in conjunction with
the dark web or other malicious activities. However, VPNs have extremely
practical uses for the day to day internet use.


**How Does A VPN Work?**

In order to use a VPN, you need VPN software. This software will encrypt your
data before it gets through to your internet service provider. Your data will
go through the VPN's server to the destination. Because your data is
middle-manned, your computer and location remains anonymous. Depending on the
type of work you do, if you work remotely you may be asked to access your
company's network via a VPN. This allows for a layer of protection on the
company's data from being compromised. 

When you want to visit a website, typically you open a browser and type in the
name of that website, this is the domain address. A domain address is an alias
for an IP Address. IP addresses are assigned to each device connected to a
computer network. These addresses can be used to track locations of the
computer as well. When you visit that website, you send your IP address and
potentially even more personal data. When you use a VPN, that data is hidden
from the end server as the information the end server gets is that of the VPN.
Although a VPN is not 100% guaranteed to protect you from every single hack, the
encryption makes it a lot harder to be cracked.
