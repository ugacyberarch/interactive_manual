We lock the\ndoors on our homes. We lock our cars.  We close our blinds.</p>\n<p>However, when it comes to the internet, it isn't always straight forward how to\nprotect ourselves, and for those of us that never have to lock our doors, or\nclose our blinds, it can feel even more unnecessary and inconvenient.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do we lock our doors?</strong></p>\n<p>Oddly enough, those of us that don't need to lock our doors can tell you the\nanswer â€” <strong>trust</strong>. If you trust your neighbors, and your community, it\nisn't necessary. The risk is low.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the internet is a global community with neighbors you <strong>cannot</strong>\ntrust, and criminals on the internet can steal a lot more than your car stereo.\nThe risk is very high.</p>\n<p>Some of you may be thinking, &quot;Locking a door won't stop a determined thief from\nbreaking a window!&quot;, and the same is true for privacy and security online. We\nwon't talk about how to put bars on every window.</p>\n<p>Experts may find the information oversimplified.  This guide is not an\nexhaustive treatment for foolproof security, it is meant to show you the basics\nof protecting yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are privacy and security important?</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that the world is very inequitable.  The incentive for bad actors is\ngreater than you can imagine, and therefore the risk is more than you have\nconsidered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cyberarch\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#cyberarch\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> CyberArch</h2>\n<p>The University of Georgia launched the Archway initiative to connect the\nresources of the University to our communities.</p>\n<p>Cybersecurity is one of the ways we hope to serve our communities.  When we\nreached out to see how we could help, we found an incredible demand for\ninformation.</p>\n<p>This is a living document that aims to develop accessible cybersecurity\ninformation. Rather than provide a list of recommendations that may seem\nfrivolous and inconvenient, our goal is to provide the context you need to\nunderstand the risks you face.</p>\n</div>\n",null]}
