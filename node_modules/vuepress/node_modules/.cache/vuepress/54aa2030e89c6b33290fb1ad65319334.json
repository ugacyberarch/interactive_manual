At receiving\nend, the packets are collected and again reassemble to get actual content as\nsent by the sender. For instance, if you are living in Atlanta and you want\nto send a gift to your uncle staying in California. Suppose your parent gave\nyou fixed-size packets and tell you to pack in these packets only. On packing\nyou courier it. Your uncle receives the packet. On receiving the packet, he\nchecks if the intended receiver is him, the number of packets are correct and\nis sender is you. If everything is right, then he accepts it.</p>\n<Firewalls-sendEmail />\n<p>However, sometime the packet which you are receiving may have malicious\ncontent. Taking forward our previous example, if you sent 3 packets to your\nUncle, but he receives 4 packets. The 4th packet is identical with other 3 in\na sense, it contains your name as sender and uncle's name as a receiver.\nSuppose your uncle is fastidious and he knows you have sent only 3 packets.\nHe, therefore, rejects the 4th packets. Precisely this is the work of\nfirewall. The way your uncle checks for all things before accepting, i.e. he\nfollows some policies for deciding on whether to accept the packet or not, in\nsimilar way firewall also has some set of policies upon which it decides\nwether to accept or reject network packet received.</p>\n<h2 id=\"software-firewall\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#software-firewall\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Software Firewall</h2>\n<p>In your system, the firewall is the bit of code installed while you install\nOperating System. On Windows,Linux and MacOS, firewalls are installed\nbefore-hand. Firewall is a software running on each system and is called a\nhost level or software firewall. A host-level firewall protects you from both\nways. It monitors incoming as well as outgoing data based on the defined set\nof rules. Host-level firewall is mostly a software firewall as it is insane\nto have a separate hardware firewall for each host.</p>\n<Firewalls-softwareFirewall />\n<h2 id=\"policies\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#policies\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Policies</h2>\n<p>Firewalls has a set of defined rules, on which it takes a decision on which\ndata packet to accept and which data packet to reject. This set of rules are\ncalled 'policies.' The policies can be user-defined or system-defined.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-away\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#take-away\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Take Away</h2>\n<p>Host-level firewall primary function is to</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not to allow any malicious data to enter your system 2) Not to allow any\ncritical data to leave your system without your consent.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",null]}
