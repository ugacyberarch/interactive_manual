It might feel like there is\nsomething inherently dishonest about &quot;secret messages&quot;, but that couldn't be\nfurther from the truth.</p>\n<p><em>Encryption is about honesty and trust.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"confidentiality\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#confidentiality\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Confidentiality</h2>\n<p>We might be better served by saying &quot;confidential information&quot; instead of\n&quot;secret messages&quot;, it doesn't have the same negative connotation.</p>\n<p>Today we do everything from shopping and banking online to e-mailing our\nbosses about trade secrets. Of course we need <em>confidentiality</em> online.</p>\n<p>It is absolutely critical that we prevent sensitive data from being\nintercepted or stolen, and to do that we need encryption.</p>\n<p>We &quot;keep&quot; <em>honesty</em> by denying unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"integrity\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#integrity\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Integrity</h2>\n<p>It is somewhat less intuitive that encryption is not only about encoding data\nbut also about authenticating data.</p>\n<p>How do you know that the data you receive is from who you think? How do you\nknow the data is intact? Was something important changed or omitted?</p>\n<p>We will see how &quot;public-key cryptography&quot; allows you to verify and trust the\nintegrity and authenticity of the data you receive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"threat-model\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#threat-model\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Threat Model</h2>\n<p>We said that encryption is necessary to prevent intercepting and stealing data,\nbut we have not discussed why those risks exists.</p>\n<p>Threat modeling is a popular way to graphically conceptualize how vulnerable you\nare to a hypothetical &quot;attacker&quot;.</p>\n<p>So let's consider your risk. Below is a model of how most people access the\ninternet from home.
