Avoiding ransomware involves an understanding of\nthe many vulnerabilities that can lead to an attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Email Security</strong></p>\n<p>Many ransomware attacks originate in the email inbox.  According to a 2016\nreport conducted by PhishMe, 93% of all phishing emails contain encryption\nransomware. These emails will include an attachment and instructions asking you\nto open it in order to launch the attack.  We cover phishing emails more in\ndepth in the section &quot;Phishing&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Backups</strong></p>\n<p>File backups are one of those things you never realize the value of preparing\nuntil you need it. There are many other computer related incidents you may need\na backup for, so it's a great practice in general. We cover backups more in\ndepth in the &quot;Backups&quot; section.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep all Software Up To Date</strong></p>\n<p>Two famous ransomware attacks WannaCry and Petna both took advantage of\nvulnerabilities in computers that had not been updated. Hackers find their\nnesting grounds for malware in unsupported and outdated systems. These systems\nhave unpatched security exploits that allow for direct access to the machine.\nThis can even render any firewall or antivirus useless. It's important to keep\nyour software and apps up to date in terms of available updates. We cover the\nimportance of software updates more in depth in the &quot;Software Updates&quot; section.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn to Identify Fake Links</strong></p>\n<p>Another common way for hackers to deliver ransomware to your computer is\nthrough fake websites advertising free content. These download links are often\ndisguised as the content the user wants to download. Majority of those sites\nlead to illegal and unethical methods of receiving that content to begin with,\nso it is best to stay clear of them completely. We cover fake links more in\ndepth in the &quot;Phishing&quot; section under fake links.</p>\n<p><strong>Have a Strong Combination of Security Software</strong></p>\n<p>A combination of a firewall, an anti-virus program, and an anti-malware program\nis recommended to help protect you. However, even the best of the best is not\nalways guaranteed to save you from every attack.</p>\n</div>\n",null]}
