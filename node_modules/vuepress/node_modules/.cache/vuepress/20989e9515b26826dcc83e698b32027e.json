When we started talking about passwords, we mentioned that\nthere were already solutions that would help you.</p>\n<p><strong>Password managers</strong> are an easy and safe way to generate and keep track of\nstrong passwords for all of your accounts.</p>\n<p>Companies like <a href=\"https://www.dashlane.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dashlane<OutboundLink/></a> and <a href=\"https://1password.com/families/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1Password<OutboundLink/></a> have apps and plugins for all of your\ndevices which will manage all of your passwords.</p>\n<p>You will no longer have to create or remember passwords. Passwords can be\ngenerated automatically and input automatically.</p>\n<p>So, you will only need to remember the password for your password manager,\nwhich will take care of the rest.</p>\n<p>However, just like your primary e-mail, it is absolutely critical that you take\nspecial care to protect this all-important &quot;password to rule them all&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n",null]}
