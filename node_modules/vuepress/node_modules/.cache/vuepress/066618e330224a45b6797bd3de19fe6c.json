You\ncan guess them all very quickly!  Fortunately, most devices and services don't\nallow you to make unlimited guesses. They may make you wait before your next\nguess, or they may just lock your account.</p>\n<p>However, when you create a password, you can never be sure how many times an\nattacker will have to guess your password.</p>\n<p>A password is <em>strong</em> if, given an unlimited number of guesses, it would still\nbe very difficult to guess.</p>\n<h2 id=\"money-y-all\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#money-y-all\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Money Y'all</h2>\n<p>Guessing a 4-digit PIN is as simple as counting from 0000 to 9999. Let us\nconsider something harder.</p>\n<p>How long would it take a computer to guess today's <em>Money Y'all</em> lottery\nnumbers?</p>\n<p><em>Money Y'all</em> is similar to, but a bit different than, the real lottery.\nNumbers can be repeated, and you have to guess the numbers in the correct order\n- like a password or PIN.</p>\n<p>Each of the five regular balls is a number from 1 to 69.

The same is true for the\npasswords you create.</p>\n<p>That is a lot more than the number of 4-digit PINs (0000 ... 9999):</p>\n<p>(10 x 10 x 10 x 10) = 10,000</p>\n</div>\n<p>How fast could a computer find the winning numbers?</p>\n<p>That depends on how many guesses your computer can make.

Only a very fast computer can test 10 billion\npasswords per second, and we will see that, even at that incredible speed, it\nis not difficult to create passwords that are very hard to guess; passwords\nthat would take hundreds and thousands of years to guess.</p>\n<p>You can enter your own password, or maybe try the passwords we talked about\nbefore (<code>P1ckl3$</code> and <code>scrubwithsoaptocleanwell</code>).
