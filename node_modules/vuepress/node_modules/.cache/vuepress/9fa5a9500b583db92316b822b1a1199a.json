Ransomware\nattacks often attempt to infect as many machines as possible on the network the\nfirst machine was connected to. It is advised to immediately disconnect any\nethernet wires, disconnect from your wi-fi network, and disconnect any other\nconnected devices such as bluetooth, NFC devices, and any other wired\nconnection.</p>\n<p><strong>Identify The Source</strong></p>\n<p>Try to recap what files could have potentially caused this. Have you downloaded\nany files from a site you're not used to? What about email attachments from\nsomeone or some &quot;company&quot; that may end up having been a phishing scam?</p>\n<p><strong>Assess The Damages</strong></p>\n<p>It is important for you to know the extent of damages. Can you access files in\ncertain folders? Are there usb devices you were connected to that also seem to\nbe rendered unusable? Some ransomware attacks such as certain web-based ones\nare just designed to scare you and your files are not actually gone.</p>\n<p><strong>Determine Next Steps</strong></p>\n<p>Typically there are 3 plans you can take next.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Restore From Backup</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a file backup from a recent enough date this will be your best\noption. Before you proceed, make sure you completely wiped your infected\nsystem. If you don't, you may risk having your backup be unusable as well.\nAfter restoring make sure you have all the data and applications you needed.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Accept The Loss</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There's not much to do in this event that results in a good situation for you.\nYou will need to just wipe the system and completely start again. Perhaps keep\nthe encrypted files backed up and look for a way to decrypt them in the future.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Pay The Ransom</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the least recommended method. Many law enforcement officials advise\nagainst it as well. You run the risk of making a payment and still having your\nfiles unusable. However, in a last case of desperation this may be the only way\nto get your files back.</p>\n</div>\n",null]}
