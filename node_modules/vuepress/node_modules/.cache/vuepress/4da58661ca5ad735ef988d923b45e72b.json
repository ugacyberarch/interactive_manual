Moreover, we know that if the site uses <code>http://</code> instead of\n<code>https://</code>, all the computers between ours and the website can also see your\npassword.</p>\n<p>Suppose that the website does support encryption. Instead of the analogy being\nmailing a key, we are in fact mailing a lockbox, with your key inside, that\nonly the website should be able to open. Would that keep your key a secret?</p>\n<p><strong>Are your passwords really secret?</strong></p>\n<Password-Login-Animation />\n<p>The server sees exactly what you input.</p>\n<p>Once shared, a secret is no longer a secret. We share our password with the\nwebsite's server.  Anyone that has or gains sufficient access to that server\ncan discover your password.</p>\n<p>Once one account is compromised, those same credentials can be used to login\nto any service where you reused them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"password-resets\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#password-resets\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Password Resets</h2>\n<p>Most of us have one primary e-mail address.</p>\n<p>Should you ever forget your username or password for a website or service you\nuse, all you have to do is click <code>Forgot password?</code> and reset it, right?.</p>\n<p>Well, that pretty much means that the password for your primary e-mail account\nis the nuclear launch codes of your personal security online.</p>\n<p>We've seen why you don't want to use predictable passwords and why you\nshouldn't reuse passwords. This is particularly important when it comes to\naccounts that allow you to reset passwords.</p>\n<p>Be vigilant. Protect your e-mail passwords earnestly. Make them strong, and\nbe very sure not to reveal them to anyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"takeaways\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#takeaways\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Takeaways</h2>\n<p>Take extra care to protect your primary e-mail account.</p>\n<p>Prefer <code>https://</code> to <code>http://</code>.</p>\n<p>Keep your passwords secret but remember they are not entirely secret.  You\nexpose your password to every service you use it on, and should any one of them\nbe compromised, or should that password be intercepted, all your accounts can\nfall like dominoes.</p>\n</div>\n",null]}
