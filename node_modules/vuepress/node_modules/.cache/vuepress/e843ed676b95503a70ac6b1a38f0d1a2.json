A simple technique for\nsomeone trying to break into an account is to try a list of frequently used\npasswords.</p>\n<p>Pretend for a moment that you are trying to create your own list of the most\ncommon passwords. The game below allows you to do just that. Guess up to ten\npasswords and see how popular they are.</p>\n<p>The score for each password corresponds to how many times that password has\nbeen seen in recent data breaches <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><OutboundLink/></a>.</p>\n<p>You may be surprised; the reference list contains over 500 million passwords.</p>\n<h2 id=\"survey-says\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#survey-says\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> &quot;Survey Says!&quot;</h2>\n<Password-FamilyFeud size=\"10\"/>\n<h2 id=\"takeaways\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#takeaways\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Takeaways</h2>\n<p>Personal does not always mean unpredictable. Try guessing a pet's name and\nappending the day of the month you were born.

We'll talk about this more when we\ndiscuss password complexity.</p>\n<p>You may have also noticed that, although you typed your password into a box\nthat hid the text you entered, it was displayed in clear text on the\nscoreboard.</p>\n<div class=\"warning custom-block\"><p class=\"custom-block-title\">WARNING</p>\n<Password-Hover />\n<p>It is a common misconception that <strong>password</strong> inputs are private or hidden.
