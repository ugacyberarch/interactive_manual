They\nshow a link that looks legitimate but does not go where you might expect.</p>\n<div class=\"danger custom-block\"><p class=\"custom-block-title\">Does this link go where you expect?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://paypal.com/account<OutboundLink/></a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Websites, and many of the e-mails you receive use a special format called HTML\nthat allows you to add structured and interactive elements.</p>\n<p>For example, if you wanted to make a table:</p>\n<Phishing-HTMLTable />\n<p>Those odd things wrapping the real content, like <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, are\ncalled &quot;tags&quot;. You may have deduced that <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> indicates the beginning of\nour table and <code>&lt;/table&gt;</code>, with the extra slash, marks the end. Likewise with\nthe table rows and table data.</p>\n<p>HTML is just a standard we started using, nothing magical, it is as arbitrary\nas which side of the road we drive on and similarly unlikely to change anytime\nsoon.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that there is a disconnect between what your\ncomputer receives and what it shows you; especially when it comes to the links\nyou see and click.</p>\n<p><strong>So, how do HTML links work?</strong></p>\n<p>Links in HTML are created with <code>&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</code> tags, but they also have an\nadditional <code>href</code> attribute that says where the link takes you.</p>\n<p>That is the most important part. What a link says, and where a link goes is not\nalways the same.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-a-team\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-a-team\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> Team</h2>\n<p>Try it for yourself. You can make your own link that goes anywhere you want and\nsays anything you want.</p>\n<Phishing-EditLink />\n<h2 id=\"hovering\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#hovering\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Hovering</h2>\n<p>Savvy users know that by pointing to a link, but not clicking it, you may get a\nclue to where it will take you. Try hovering over the <code>Click HERE!</code> link below.</p>\n<Phishing-Window url=\"http://example.com\">\n  <Phishing-StatusBar href=\"http://example.com/test\" content=\"Click HERE!\" />\n</Phishing-Window>\n<p>Check the bottom of your own browser window when you hover over a link, it may\nshow something similar.</p>\n<p>It is an excellent idea to &quot;look before you leap&quot;, but unfortunately even the\nstatus bar is not completely trustworthy. Try clicking the link, it won't take\nyou where it says!</p>\n<p>Why did we even bring it up? Well, we don't want you to have a false sense of\nsecurity. There is really one authority for where you are and where you end up,\nand that is the <strong>address bar</strong>:</p>\n<Phishing-Window url=\"Search Google or type a URL\" />\n<h2 id=\"urls\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#urls\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> URLs</h2>\n<p>Clicking a link makes your browser go to another address. Addresses can also be\ncopied or typed directly into the address bar.</p>\n<p>The address bar is pretty flexible, but it does require some understanding of a\nweb standard called URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to use.</p>\n<p>Wait, &quot;links&quot;, &quot;addresses&quot;, &quot;URLs&quot;?</p>\n<p>Links are what we actually click on; they take us to an address, which is also\ncalled a URL. Don't worry about it, you can call them &quot;links&quot;, &quot;addresses&quot;, or\n&quot;URLs&quot;.</p>\n<p>The important part is you understand how to read the address bar to determine\nif you are where you expect to be. So, let's decipher a URL.</p>\n<Phishing-URL />\n<h2 id=\"searching\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#searching\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Searching</h2>\n<p>The way we use the internet has been completely changed by &quot;search engines&quot;. A\nlot of people navigate the internet by searching for every website they use.</p>\n<Phishing-Window url=\"https://www.google.com\">\n  <Phishing-Search />\n</Phishing-Window>\n<p>In fact, browsers have acknowledged this trend and have integrated search into\nthe address bar. Perhaps you remember just a few years ago when browsers had\ntwo separate fields, and we used the field on the right side to search.</p>\n<p>Now that you know how the address bar works, instead of searching, you might\ntry to type out important domain names instead of searching for them.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of searching for <code>PayPal</code>, go ahead and add\n<code>.com</code> so you go directly there.</p>\n<p>Malware and malicious plugins have been known to show fake search results so\nthat you mistakenly go to a bad website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"address-bar\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#address-bar\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Address Bar</h2>\n<p>Imagine for a second that your bank is on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor of a\nbuilding. You will likely use the elevator to reach your bank.  So, you get\ninto the elevator and you press the button. The doors close, the elevator takes\nyou up, and the doors open.</p>\n<p><em>How do you know that you are actually on the floor you want to be on?</em></p>\n<p>In many ways, links on webpages and in your e-mail are like the buttons inside\nan elevator. You click the link and you expect it to take you to the right\nplace.</p>\n<p>You might also look for confirmation that you are where you want to be â€”\nperhaps a placard that shows the floor you are on, maybe there is an indicator\nabove the doors, or maybe you will just look out and see if it looks like your\nbank.</p>\n<Phishing-Window url=\"http://office-building.com/ground-floor\">\n  <Phishing-Elevator />\n</Phishing-Window>\n<p>Unfortunately, and this is the most valuable lesson for protecting yourself\nfrom Phishing attacks, you cannot trust the buttons you click nor the way the\nwebsite looks when you arrive.</p>\n<p>You must be perpetually skeptical.</p>\n<p>You are the target of a grand heist. They have switched the buttons inside the\nelevator and when the door opens it actually looks like your bank. You may\nthink they redecorated a little, but in fact, the entire floor is a fake,\ndesigned entirely to dupe you.</p>\n<p>While it would be far-fetched in the real world to build a fake bank, it is\nentirely possible to create a fake banking website.</p>\n<p><em>How do you know you are actually on the website you want to be on?</em></p>\n<p>You must check your address bar!</p>\n<p>The difference between <code>https://chase.com-onlinebanking.com/</code> and\n<code>https://chase.com</code> could be your life savings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"takeaways\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#takeaways\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Takeaways</h2>\n<p>Don't trust what a link says.</p>\n<p>Find the domain name in a URL.</p>\n<p>Always check the URL in the address bar.</p>\n</div>\n",null]}
