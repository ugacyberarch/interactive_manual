However, VPNs have extremely\npractical uses for the day to day internet use.</p>\n<p><strong>How Does A VPN Work?</strong></p>\n<p>In order to use a VPN, you need VPN software. This software will encrypt your\ndata before it gets through to your internet service provider. Your data will\ngo through the VPN's server to the destination. Because your data is\nmiddle-manned, your computer and location remains anonymous. Depending on the\ntype of work you do, if you work remotely you may be asked to access your\ncompany's network via a VPN. This allows for a layer of protection on the\ncompany's data from being compromised.</p>\n<p>When you want to visit a website, typically you open a browser and type in the\nname of that website, this is the domain address. A domain address is an alias\nfor an IP Address. IP addresses are assigned to each device connected to a\ncomputer network. These addresses can be used to track locations of the\ncomputer as well. When you visit that website, you send your IP address and\npotentially even more personal data. When you use a VPN, that data is hidden\nfrom the end server as the information the end server gets is that of the VPN.\nAlthough a VPN is not 100% guaranteed to protect you from every single hack, the\nencryption makes it a lot harder to be cracked.</p>\n</div>\n",null]}
