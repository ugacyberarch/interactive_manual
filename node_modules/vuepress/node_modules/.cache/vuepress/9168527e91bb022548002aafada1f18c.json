Let's develop an\nanalogy that will help you understand how they work, their shortcomings, and\nconsequently the risk you face. First, we start by thinking about a password as\na <em>key</em>. You create a password, a key, that unlocks the door to your account.</p>\n<p>Notice that while we are used to buying locks with keys that fit them, with\npasswords, you are actually responsible for creating a good key, while the\nwebsite is responsible for making a lock for it to fit. A simple or common\npassword, just like a simple or reused key, will result in a lock that is\neasily picked.</p>\n<p>We will talk about how to make strong passwords later, but we need to\nacknowledge some additional differences between how we use locks and keys every\nday, and how they work online.</p>\n<Password-SVG-Exchange />\n<p>Usually, you unlock your own house or car, right?  Online, you don't unlock\nthings yourself. Instead, you give your key to someone else to unlock your\naccount.</p>\n<p>This is a very important difference that reveals other risks you face.</p>\n<Password-SVG-Network />\n<p>Every time you login to a website, you send your key across the internet to\nthe website's servers.</p>\n<p>The internet is one massive &quot;network&quot; of computers. On computer networks, you\npass data from one computer to the next, until it reaches its destination.  In\nour example, the destination is the web server.</p>\n<p>You might imagine what additional risks you might face if you were to mail\nsomeone a key.</p>\n<Password-SVG-Encrypted />\n<p>Unless your data is <strong>encrypted</strong>, any computer that forwards your data can see\nyour password.</p>\n<p>You cannot control if the website supports encryption, but you should be aware\nof whether your data is protected or not, i.e. if the website uses <code>https://</code>.</p>\n<p>Thinking about passwords as keys will continue to be helpful as we talk about\npassword security.</p>\n<p>Next, we will talk about common passwords. Imagine if there were only a few\ndozen variations of keys for a lock. Intruders would find it easy to simply try\nall of the possible keys.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attribution\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#attribution\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Attribution</h2>\n<br>\n<div>Icons made by <a href=\"http://www.freepik.com\" title=\"Freepik\">Freepik</a> from <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\" title=\"Flaticon\">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" title=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0\" target=\"_blank\">CC 3.0 BY</a></div>\n</div>\n",null]}
