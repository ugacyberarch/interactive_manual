Network\nfirewalls are usually a hardware device, installed to protect large servers\nand internal private networks.</p>\n<p>Let's consider organization XYZ is throwing the success party for its\nemployees. Only the employees of the organization with valid invitation is\nallowed to enter the party with a partner. The dedicated bodyguard at the\nentrance, checks if the guests have the valid invitation. The people not\nhaving valid invitation are not allowed to enter the party.</p>\n<p>Network firewall works in the same way. It acts as the body guard at the\nentrance of the organization network and allows only the packets which\nfull-fill the defined policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hardware-firewall\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#hardware-firewall\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Hardware Firewall</h2>\n<p>Hardware firewall is the device which looks similarly like big router and its\ncontrol by network administrator of the organization. Hardware firewall\nrequires timely maintenance and also the expert technician to install and\nmaintain it.</p>\n<img :src=\"$withBase('/Firewall.png')\">\n<p>The below example simulates the scenario of with and without firewall. You\ncan see if the firewall is not present, the legitimate as well as malicious\npacket enters the network. But incase of firewall, the malicious packet is\nnot allowed to enter the network.</p>\n<Firewalls-SVG-firewall_network />\n<h2 id=\"policies\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#policies\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Policies</h2>\n<p>Polices are the set of rules which governs the working of firewalls. The set\nof rules are defined by network administrator of organization and its common\nfor all the hosts in that networks. Unlike host firewalls, where all hosts\nhas its own set of rules, network firewalls defines the rules for each host\nin that network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attributions\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#attributions\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Attributions</h2>\n<div>Icons made by <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/authors/flat-icons\" title=\"Flat Icons\">Flat Icons</a> from <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\" title=\"Flaticon\">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" title=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0\" target=\"_blank\">CC 3.0 BY</a></div></div>\n",null]}
