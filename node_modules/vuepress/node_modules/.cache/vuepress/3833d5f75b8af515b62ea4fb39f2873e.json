Whe\nyou say you are connected to the internet, it means you are in the network of\n10000000000000000000000... computers in the world and you can connect them.\nBut in that network you are also one node, and you need to be secured in such\na wide network.</p>\n<p>Internet is the network of computers which are connected with each other.\nWhen the data is transfer over the internet it is transferred in the form of\nthe packets. For instance, when you send the email with the attachment to\nsomeone, the data is divided into packets and send on the internet. At the\nreceiving end, the data also arrives in form of packets and is manipulated\naccordingly.</p>\n<p>As internet, is the world wide network, and there are many devices connected\nto each other. You can imagine how much packets must be getting transferred\nevery day. Traffic management mechanism is implemented in the network for\nsmooth delivery of the data through packets.</p>\n<p>Right now you are reading this manual, so the data you are reading now must\nhave received on your device inform of packets. The actual path followed is\nfrom the uga.edu server data is sent in form of packets, which travels\ninternet to reach your router. Your router then direct the packets to your\ndevice.</p>\n<p>As we said, internet is wide network and you are connected to it. So you are\nthe part of that wide network and is interacting with world. The data on the\ninternet flows in two ways. That means from your internet to computer and\nvice-versa. So someone need to monitor what is sent and what is receive from\nthe internet. Firewall can be considered as the dedicated bodyguard which\nallows only the guests having valid invitation for the party. Firewalls\nmonitors the data coming in and going out of the network and hence protect\nyou.</p>\n<p>You may get some unintended and unwelcome data packets. This packets may\ncontain some malicious data which can cause some threat to your device. Also,\nsomething unwanted may get transfer from your device on internet. There may\nbe a malicious request to your device, asking for some information. You must\nbe protected from such scenarios and firewall help in achieving it.</p>\n<p>Firewalls can be either software running on your computer or a physical\nfirewall device.</p>\n<p>Firewalls are the your body guards who protect you on such large network.</p>\n<p>Firewalls are essential add security at different levels in the network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attribution\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#attribution\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Attribution</h2>\n<div>Icons made by <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/authors/eucalyp\" title=\"Eucalyp\">Eucalyp</a> from <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\" title=\"Flaticon\">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\" title=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0\" target=\"_blank\">CC 3.0 BY</a></div></div>\n",null]}
