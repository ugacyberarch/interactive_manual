For instance, when you send the email with the attachment to\nsomeone, the data is divided into packets and send on the internet. At the\nreceiving end, the data also arrives in form of packets and is manipulated\naccordingly.</p>\n<p>As internet, is the world wide network, and there are many devices connected\nto each other. You can imagine how much packets must be getting transferred\nevery day. Traffic management mechanism is implemented in the network for\nsmooth delivery of the data through packets.</p>\n<p>Right now you are reading this manual, so the data you are reading now must\nhave received on your device inform of packets. The actual path followed is\nfrom the uga.edu server data is sent in form of packets, which travels\ninternet to reach your router.

There may\nbe a malicious request to your device, asking for some information. You must\nbe protected from such scenarios and firewall help in achieving it.</p>\n<p>Firewalls can be either software running on your computer or a physical\nfirewall device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"takeaway\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#takeaway\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Takeaway</h2>\n</div>\n",null]}
